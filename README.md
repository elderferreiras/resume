## Resume 

https://www.elderf.com/

This project is a React version of the resume template created by [Xiaoying Riley](https://twitter.com/xyriley) at [3rd Wave Media](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/). Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), this project implements components to allow for code reuse. The main component, App.js, reaches out to API Gateway, which calls a Lambda function that goes to a DynamoDB table to grab the resume data.
